# New Sun Rising:
the website in on the http://test.newsunrising.org
nonprofit giving the information to small business. 
``` data access ```
``` gathering information to start business ```

# project directory

## NSR_website
the whole website with backend & frontend
### backend
- function.py: contains all the function related data
- view.py: this is the control to the related view 
- url.py: backend data requests url
### frontend
using Vue.js as framework
### frontend_2
since the Server NSR(the company) using is a public server which I can not build the backend Django server on the cloud. I transfer all the function in the frontend. Since currently all the data could be get from the static data file, we can do the static website to show all the information we want.

# how to run
git the folder. Open the NSR_webstie in the pycharm and runserver
